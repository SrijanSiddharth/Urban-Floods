# Urban Flood Risk Prediction and Modeling

This project develops a **spatiotemporal flood risk prediction framework** for **100 Indian Smart Cities**, integrating geospatial, climatic, and socio-economic datasets using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** models.  

Flood risk is assessed through its three principal components ‚Äî **Hazard**, **Vulnerability**, and **Exposure** ‚Äî which are quantified, combined, and modelled to predict urban flood risk across space and time.

## üß≠ Project Overview

Urban flooding is an increasingly critical challenge in India due to rapid urbanization, changing rainfall patterns, and climate variability.

This project provides a **data-driven and scalable workflow** to estimate and model flood risk, enabling improved disaster preparedness and urban resilience planning.

The workflow follows a systematic pipeline:

## üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Visualization

An interactive flood risk visualization is available here:  
üëâ [Smart City Flood Analysis Tool ‚Äì GEE App](https://ee-smartcities56.projects.earthengine.app/view/smart-city-flood-analysis-tool)

This app allows users to visualize hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and total risk layers for each Indian smart city.
